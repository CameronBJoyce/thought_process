two datasets go in this folder:
1. your thought process generation dataset (csv, or if you change the code, it can be whatever file type you want).
    a. So you would give your context, start state, end state, and whatever other fields you want reflected in the possible though process outputs.
    
2. the training set of human annotated thought processes with an assigned quality score
    b. two columns, plain text and a score.
